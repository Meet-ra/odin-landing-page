            <h1>This page is dedicated to the memory of Arthur C. Clarke</h1>
            <p>Clarke was a science fiction writer, an avid populariser of space travel, and a futurist of
                 distinguished ability. He wrote many books and many essays for popular magazines. In 1961,
                  he received the Kalinga Prize, a UNESCO award for popularising science.<br>
                   Clarke's science and science fiction writings earned him the moniker "Prophet of the Space Age".
                    His science fiction writings in particular earned him a number of Hugo and Nebula awards,
                     which along with a large readership, made him one of the towering figures of the genre.<br></p>
                      <!-- For many years Clarke, Robert Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov were known as the "Big Three" of
                       science fiction. Clarke co-wrote the screenplay for the 1968 film 2001:
                 A Space Odyssey, widely regarded as one of the most influential films of all time.</p> -->
